OpenURL
==========
#### Current Version: 1.1.4

This is a simple and lightweight addon that allows any server admin to open the any website on a any connected player.

This addon has the ability to open the website in either a custom in-game browser or you can use the steam web browser.

If you want to play a YouTube video you could enable the 'YouTube Video' mode and when the website loads on the selected player it will put it in fullscreen and auto-play the video.

If your worried about admins opening rude or illegal websites on players, Don't be. The player that you want to open the website on has to verify that his/her wants to open it before anything happens.

You can open the menu by typing '/url' into chat.
