OpenURL is a simple and lightweight addon that allows any admins to open the URL of a website on a any connected player.
This does not open it in the steam web browser instead it uses a custom in-game menu.

You can open the menu by typing '/url' into chat (Command is admin-only)

Current Version: 1.1.0
