OpenURL is a simple and lightweight addon that allows any admins to open the URL of a website on a any connected player.

You can open the menu by typing '/url' into chat (Command is admin only)

It also has a verification menu so players cannot open annoying menus on other players.

Current Version: 1.1.3

If you get any errors with this addon, or maybe something is not working for you create a new issue (https://github.com/viral32111/openurl/issues)
